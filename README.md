        Add your keys to the .env.example file in BE and FE directories.

        Rename .env.example to .env in both BE and FE directories.
    Configure Firebase Admin Access (Backend):

        Create a new Firebase project with Cloud Firestore (or use an existing one).

        Get your Firebase project configuration from the Firebase Console:
        Go to your project ‚Üí Project settings (gear icon) ‚Üí Service accounts ‚Üí Generate new private key ‚Üí Firebase SDK snippet.
        Copy the config object and paste it into adminConfig.example or import the .json file and change its name to adminConfig.json.

        Rename adminConfig.example to adminConfig.json and add your Firebase keys.

Handling Your Private Firebase Key (Alternative Method)

‚ö†Ô∏è **You can also set up your private Firebase key like this:**

    Download your private key
    Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Service Accounts ‚Üí Generate new private key.
    This will download a .json file to your computer.

    Create a config folder
    In your backend root (BE), create a folder called config.

    Move your .json file
    Move (or copy) the downloaded .json file into the config folder.

    Update the path in your code
    Open the following files and update the path to your JSON file:

        BE/utils/admin.js

const { join } = require('path');
// Change the filename after 'config/' to your actual file name
const serviceAccountPath = join(__dirname, '../config/your-filename.json');

BE/utils/delete-collection.js

        const { join } = require('path');
        // Change the filename after 'config/' to your actual file name
        const serviceAccountPath = join(__dirname, '../config/your-filename.json');

    Tip:
    Replace your-filename.json with the actual name of your downloaded JSON file, e.g., bostr-chatbot-firebase-adminsdk-xxxxxx.json.
